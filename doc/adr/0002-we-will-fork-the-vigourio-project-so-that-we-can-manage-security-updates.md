Date: 2025-08-22

## Status

Accepted

## Context
The vigour-io package is useful but hasn't been touched in 9 years. There is
a vulnerability with 2 PRs already but the maintainers have not taken action.

## Consequences
What becomes easier or more difficult to do and any risks introduced by the
change that will need to be mitigated.
