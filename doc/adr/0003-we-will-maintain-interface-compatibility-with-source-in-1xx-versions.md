# 3. We will maintain interface compatibility with source in 1.x.x versions

Date: 2025-08-22

## Status

Accepted

## Context
This project has been forked from https://github.com/vigour-io/unflatten and
the associated npm package already has a fair number of users.

## Decision
We will maintain compatibility with the vigour-io package in all versions
compatible with 1.0.0

## Consequences
Makes it easier for people who use the vigour version to switch to this package.
