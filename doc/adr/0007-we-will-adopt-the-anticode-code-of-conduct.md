# 0007. We will adopt the Anticode Code of Conduct

Date: 2025-08-25

## Status

Accepted

## Context
We need to meet Github's recommended open source project guidelines,
specifically adopt a Code of Conduct, for the reasons outlined in the first
paragraph of [this page][1]. Quoted here:

> Repository maintainers can review their public repository's community profile
> to learn how they can help grow their community and support contributors.
> Contributors can view a public repository's community profile to see if they
> want to contribute to the project.

We decide against the [Contributor Covenant][3] and the
[Citizen Code of Conduct][4] for the following reasons:

1. Too wordy.
1. Excessive focus on concepts outside the scope of this software project.

## Decision
We will adopt webb's [Anticode][2] for this project.

## Consequences
We will have a code of conduct with minimal wording, which focuses on what is
important.
