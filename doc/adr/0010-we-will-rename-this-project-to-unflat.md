# 10. We will rename this project to unflat

Date: 2025-08-23

## Status

Accepted

## Context
The name "unflatten" is already taken by the source project.

## Decision
We will rename this project to `unflat`. The name of the exported function will
remain the same.

## Consequences
We can now publish on npm.
Users of the source package wishing to migrate to this one will have to manually
update references.
