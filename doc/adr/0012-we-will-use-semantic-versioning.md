# 12. We will use semantic versioning

Date: 2025-08-24

## Status

Accepted

## Context
Release versions must communicate meaning to end-users.

## Decision
We will use semantic versioning in the form of Major.Minor.Patch, according to
https://semver.org/

* Major signifies new versions
* Minor signifies new functionality
* Patch signifies fixes, but no change to the interface

## Consequences
We are already using semantic versioning, just documenting the decision.
